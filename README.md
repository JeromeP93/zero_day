# My ALX-SE Project (Zero Day)

This is my implementation of the task to create and setup my Git and GitHub account, and create my first repository as a full-stack software engineer.

## Tasks

- Create this git repository remotely
- Initialize git locally and add the remote origin
- Create this README.md file
- then commit and push to the remote server / origin
